## Summary:

Based on the weather analysis, the difference in Average Temperature between June & December, is not a significant difference, although December's standard deviation is higher due to the wider range in temperatures differnces during the month of December. We can assume there is a higher chance of unfavorable weather occurances during the month of December rather than June for Surfing & Ice Cream. 
After running additional queries on precipitation, there is a higher chance of rain, sleet or snow to occure during the month of December. 
Also a general statistical summary of Oahu, Hawaii weather from 2010-2017 has an average temperature of 73 degrees and a low average of recorded precipitation at 16% over the 8 year timespan. I beileve Oahu is a suitable location for the Surf's Up business.
